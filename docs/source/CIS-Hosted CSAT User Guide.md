If you already have a CSAT account, are an admin, and would like add new users, see this [knowledge base article](https://cisecurity.atlassian.net/l/cp/pLhyB1PX). 

## The Basics

This section describes the basic CSAT Pro concepts including users, organizations, and assessments, as well as how they relate to each other.

### Users and Privileges

There are 3 types of users in CIS-Hosted CSAT: 

| User Type   | Permissions |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Primary Owner      | Access to full functionality for the organization and all sub-organizations       |
| Admin   | Access to all the functionality and dashboard for the organization, but does not have access to sub-organizations        |
| Basic User/Member  |  Access to Sub-Controls that are assigned to the user

Here are some use case examples;

- Admin user would have access to the full assessment and assessment history of the organization in question, but not of the sub-organizations.  The Admin would be able to create/delete assessments for their organization, and would be able to add/delete users to that organization, not for any of the sub-organizations.

- If you do not want a user to have access to add/delete users, or create/delete assessments in that organization, you could go with a basic user/member, and assign that basic user to all Sub-Controls or a subset of the Sub-Controls.  With the new bulk assignment ability in CIS CSAT v1.3.0 it is easier to assign a large number of Sub-Controls to a single user.
