Nick's Notes. 
Confused on the mkdocs.yml. The documentation states: A basic MkDocs configuration is stored here, including a few extensions for MkDocs and Markdown. Add your own configurations here, such as extensions and themes. Remember that many extensions and themes require additional Python packages to be installed
Parami has the navigation panel set in the mkdocs.yml. I don't believe that is correct. The *.md files make up the big chunks/sections and within those files you set the subsections with the informtion. Everything in a big sections is containted in the *.md files

It sounds like this will be hosted in a Docker Container?
